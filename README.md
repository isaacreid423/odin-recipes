# odin-recipes

This is a small website that will contain links for various recipes. it will have a main index page with links to a few other pages which contain recipes. on each of these pages i will write a short description about the food, include a picture of the food, include the ingredients in an unordered list and include the steps in an ordered list This is inteded as a practice of my knowledge of HTML. This is probably not exciting at all for anyone to check out or visit since I am a total noob at this point but feel free to check it out if you wish.
